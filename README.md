# üè∞ Vladivostok Fortress Metaverse

## üìú Overview

The Vladivostok Fortress Metaverse project is an immersive virtual experience that reconstructs the historical fortress system built from 1889 to 1918 in Vladivostok, Russia. This project utilizes Unity and Spatial.io to create a detailed, interactive 3D model of the fortress, reflecting its historical significance and architectural complexity.

## üìö Historical Context

The Vladivostok Fortress was constructed to incorporate lessons learned from the Russo-Japanese War, making it one of the most fortified structures of its time. The construction was about two-thirds complete when it was halted due to the disruptions caused by the First World War and the October Revolution. The fortress stands as a testament to the military strategies and engineering of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
